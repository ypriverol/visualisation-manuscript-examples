# Histogram Example

JFreeChart is an open source library for Java to generate graphs and charts easily. JFreeChart allows the users to generate pie
chart, bar chart, timeseries chart, Gantt chart, histogram, X-Y charts and various specific charts. In this JFreeChart tutorial,
we will go through JFreeChart example (JFreeChart pie chart, JFreeChart bar chart and JFreeChart timeseries chart).

# Scatter Matrix Example

The scatterplot matrix visualizations pairwise correlations for multi-dimensional data; each cell in the matrix is a scatterplot.
This example uses Anderson's data of iris flowers on the Gaspé Peninsula. Scatterplot matrix design invented by J. A. Hartigan.
Matrix is an extension of a scatter plot for multidimensional data where a collection of scatter plots is organized in a matrix
to provide correlation information among the attributes. This is particularly effective in pinpointing specific variables that
might have similar correlations to particular genomics, proteomics or metabolomics data.

# Box plots Example

A box-and-whisker plot uses simple glyphs that summarize a quantitative distribution with five standard statistics: the smallest
value, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and largest value. This summary approach allows the viewer to easily recognize 
differences between distributions. Data from the Michelson–Morley experiment. Implementation contributed by Jason Davies.
This example periodically randomizes the values to demonstrate transitions.

# Bullet plot Example

Designed by Stephen Few, a bullet chart “provides a rich display of data in a small space.” A variation on a bar chart, bullet
charts compare a given quantitative measure (such as profit or revenue) against qualitative ranges (e.g., poor, satisfactory,
good) and related markers (e.g., the same measure a year ago). The "update" button randomizes the values slightly to demonstrate
transitions.
