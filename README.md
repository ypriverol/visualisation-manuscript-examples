# Scatter Matrix Example

The scatterplot matrix visualizations pairwise correlations for multi-dimensional data; each cell in the matrix is a scatterplot.
This example uses Anderson's data of iris flowers on the Gasp√© Peninsula. Scatterplot matrix design invented by J. A. Hartigan.
Matrix is an extension of a scatter plot for multidimensional data where a collection of scatter plots is organized in a matrix
to provide correlation information among the attributes. This is particularly effective in pinpointing specific variables that
might have similar correlations to particular genomics, proteomics or metabolomics data.
